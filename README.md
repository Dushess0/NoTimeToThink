# NoTimeToThink
##About the game
It is multiplayer chess-like game. Figures moves just like in chess and the goal is kill enemy king.

##Things to remember
1) There are only 20 player online possible. (I am using Photon free plan)
2) It is recommended to play with friend:
   i. Double the fun
   ii. There is no anticheat in game
   iii. Faster matchmaking
3) There are a dozens of hidden mechanics (they are not bugs, they are features :)  You can find most of them on wiki
but I recommend you to find them all without reading wiki.

5) There is No Time To Read this readme, just download and play the game. (Click the "Releases" button on top of the page to find 
the latest release)
