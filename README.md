# NoTimeToThink
## About the game
It is multiplayer chess-like game. Figures moves just like in chess and the goal is kill enemy king. There are no turns both players moves independently, but every figure has different move speed and cooldown.

## Things to remember
1) There are only 20 player online possible. (I am using Photon free plan)
2) It is recommended to play with friend:
   i. Double the fun
   ii. There is no anticheat in game
   iii. Faster matchmaking
3) There are a dozens of hidden mechanics (they are not bugs, they are features :)  You can find most of them on wiki (there is no wiki yet) but I recommend you to find them all without reading wiki.
4) This beatifull music written by Will Halimou! Check his soundcloud https://soundcloud.com/williamhalimou/sets/chess-music
